This repository contains an adapted version of the original OAT-training code for the paper [Obfuscated Activations Bypass LLM Latent-Space Defenses](https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09565). The original repository can be found at https://github.com/LukeBailey181/obfuscated-activations.

Run `compute_oat_probes.py` to train an OAT model! You may want to check its default parameters.
